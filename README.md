First, I load the JSON file to access the raw data. Subsequently, I iterate through the keys of the data twice, employing a nested loop structure. Within this loop, I extract information about the participating teams and their respective opponents. To ensure the integrity of the analysis, I implement a conditional check; if a team is identical to its opponent, the corresponding data is skipped. This is a crucial step, as a team cannot logically play against itself.

Furthermore, I undertake a reordering process to align the data format with the specified example. This involves restructuring the data entries to match the desired order. By meticulously following these steps, I aim to create a well-organized and logically formatted output that adheres to the prescribed guidelines. This approach not only ensures data accuracy but also enhances the readability and coherence of the final output, aligning it seamlessly with the provided example.
